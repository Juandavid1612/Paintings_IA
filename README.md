## To Use the code you need to:
* Download the .zip files 
* Upload it to the collab

## How did i collect that much images of each painter?
 I used a extension of chrome called "Download all images", that allows you to download every image of the thing you searched on the browser. ( anyway i had to make some distortions to each image like rotate it, zoom it, move it so the model had more variation of images to be trained )
