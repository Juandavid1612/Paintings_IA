# Paintings_IA

## Painters this model can classify:
* Picasso
* Van Gogh
* Alfred Kubin

## Purpose
Making a IA capable to tell whoÂ´s painting it is, giving the url of the image

## To Use the code need to:

* Download the .zip files 
* Upload it to the collab

## How did i collect that much images of each painter?
 I used a extension of chrome called "Download all images", that allows you to download every image of the thing you searched on the browser. ( anyway i had to make some distortions to each image like rotate it, zoom it, move it so the model had more variation of images to be trained ) 
 
 ### Hope you find it interesting see ya :D
