# Paintings_IA 🤖🖌

I presented this as my final project of IA at the college, wanted to apply what i learned in class to classify images so here we are

## Painters 👨‍🎨 this model can classify:
* Picasso
* Van Gogh
* Alfred Kubin

## Purpose
Making a IA capable to tell who´s painting it is, giving the url of the image

## Link to the data
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jig5B6PMEnfBBzr6N45dRrZ-hg-C9XnY/view?usp=share_link
Unzip "data" and upload to the collab the zips of each painter :)

## Link to the collab
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XxfPn6bnhpxSk_AnSBpGIWHGTxnuylt2?usp=sharing

## To Use the code you need to:
* Download the .zip files 
* Upload it to the collab

## How did i collect that much images of each painter?
 I used a extension of chrome called "Download all images", that allows you to download every image of the thing you searched on the browser. ( anyway i had to make some distortions to each image like rotate it, zoom it, move it so the model had more variation of images to be trained ) 
 
 ### Hope you find it interesting see ya :D
